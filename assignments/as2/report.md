# Assignment 2: Polygon creation tool

This assignment was quite interesting, I learned a lot about basic drawing with OpenGL and how this could be used as a platform for development. I used the provided `interactiveTriangle.cpp` file to help guide the coding process, especially to find the callback functions which could update a live mouse position and detect mouse clicks. It helped to use this resource: [glBegin docs](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL-Refpages/gl2.1/xhtml/glBegin.xml).

You could try using unique ptrs for heap cleanup
